# HelloNetwork

A basic Nerves sample to bring up the network.
This sample will grow, but for now it just starts the network.

### Limitations

- no tests right now
- no documentation right now
- only tested on rpi, rpi2 (but likely works on bbb, alix also)
- no discovery
- nothing actually runs on the port
- supports only ip4ll and dhcp (no interface for static IP)
