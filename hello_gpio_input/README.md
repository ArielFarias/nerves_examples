# Hello GPIO Input

This example demonstrates how to use General-Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins as digital inputs using the `elixir_ale` library.

## Hardware
Connect a 4-pin push-button with a 10 kÎ©  pull-down resistor to a GPIO pin.

Schematic:

The default configuration uses GPIO pin 26, which can be found on a Raspberry Pi using the following diagram from https://pinout.xyz:

## How to Use this Repository

1. Connect the hardware according to the schematic above
2. Configure which input pin to use by editing `config\config.exs`
3. Get dependencies with `mix deps.get`
4. Create firmware with `mix firmware`
5. Burn firmware to an SD card with `mix firmware.burn`
6. Connect a monitor to the HDMI port on the board
7. Insert the SD card into your target board and power it on
8. After it finishes booting (about 5 seconds), pressing the button will log events to the console on the HDMI monitor

The default target is set to Raspberry Pi 3.
If you are creating an image for any other target, either change the default in `mix.exs` or preface all mix commands with a `NERVES_TARGET` environment variable.
For example, if you're using a BeagleBone Black:

``` bash
NERVES_TARGET=bbb mix deps.get
NERVES_TARGET=bbb mix firmware
NERVES_TARGET=bbb mix firmware.burn
```
