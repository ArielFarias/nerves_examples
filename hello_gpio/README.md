# Hello GPIO

This example demonstrates how to control General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins using the `elixir_ale` library.

## Hardware

You will need a singe LED connected to GND and a GPIO pin with a 270 Î© resistor.

The default configuration uses GPIO pin 26, which can be found on a Raspberry Pi using the following diagram from https://pinout.xyz:

## How to use the code in the repository

1. Connect the hardware according to the schematic above
2. Configure which output pin to use by editing `config/config.exs`
3. Specify your target with the `MIX_TARGET` environment variable
4. Get dependencies with `mix deps.get`
5. Create firmware with `mix firmware`
6. Burn firmware to an SD card with `mix firmware.burn`
7. Insert the SD card into your target board and power it on
8. After about 5 seconds, the LED should start blinking

``` bash
MIX_TARGET=rpi3
mix deps.get
mix firmware
mix firmware.burn
```
